WWI Summer School 17

<h1>Use-Case Description:</h1>
<b>Problem</b> <br>
Waste Management is an integral part of every municipality. Most current systems lack insight into their management solutions. Without insight into live statistics about different conditions of the waste produced in homes, the system is handicapped as to how efficient it can be, leading to a lot of wasted resources and labor hours.

<b>Solution</b> <br>
Our Smart Waste Management Solution resolves this problem. By leveraging IoT we are now able to collect live statistics of everyday household items. Our solution implements sensors in each household garbage bin to report live statistics about its conditions. Knowing whether a garbage bin is full, empty, or how long it has been since it was last collected can help optimize daily collection routes. Doing this provides not only financials savings to the company, but also a more environmentally friendly solution. Please view our presentation for more details and how the Smart Waste Management Solution can benefit you.
